# Empire JS

Yeah! Just like the name says Empire JS, I am building an empire with JavaScript by advancing in JavaScript patterns, techniques and best practices.

<br>
The sole aim of building this empire is to become an expert in using the JavaScript language both as a standalone tool and in combination with other tools.

<br>

This project repo will be updated from time to time as I keep learning and exploring new concepts and new things.

Happy Hacking!!!!
